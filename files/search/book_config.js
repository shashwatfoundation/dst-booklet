This highlights the need to monitor \u000d\u000asuspicious activities at railway stations. \u000d\u000aInstalling scanners and cameras will \u000d\u000asignificantly help to detect any suspicious\u000d\u000aactivities and prevent crimes. \u000d\u000aTo solve this problem, Priyanka Kumari \u000d\u000afrom grade 9, of Kendriya Vidyalaya \u000d\u000aBolarum, Telangana has proposed an \u000d\u000aAI-enabled camera that detects the \u000d\u000acriminal history of a person based on the \u000d\u000adata uploaded. These cameras will be \u000d\u000ainstalled at the entrance gates of the \u000d\u000arailway station and in sensitive zones which \u000d\u000aare most prone to crimes. The camera will \u000d\u000adetect any suspicious criminal activity to \u000d\u000aimmediately notify the police.\u000d\u000aThis human detector model uses Computer\u000d\u000aVision technology to help identify persons\u000d\u000aat railway stations. OpenCV algorithm is \u000d\u000aused which is an open-source library for \u000d\u000aprocessing images. It also uses Tensorflow, \u000d\u000awhich is an open-source framework to \u000d\u000arun image processing techniques. \u000d\u000aCameras can be installed for security \u000d\u000achecks at the entrance for the identification\u000d\u000aof humans. Upon detection of any suspected\u000d\u000acriminal activities, this AI-based technology\u000d\u000awill alert the police at the railway station. \u000d\u000aIt can further be developed to be used at \u000d\u000avarious locations which are prone to \u000d\u000acrimes. Going ahead, the accuracy of this \u000d\u000atechnology will be improved by incorporating\u000d\u000anumerous datasets.
